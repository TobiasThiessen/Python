## YUGIOH Database w Card Pricing
A simple program that allows the user to add their YUGIOH collection to a database. By manually writing the unique card number from a yugioh card into the prompted field, it will use the API (see readme in project folder) to search for data about the card, which can be commited to a local database saved in same folder as the project. 
The program also allows the user to view their collection in database, along with various information such as prices obtained by the API.
